# Portfolio
## My portfolio website

#DESCRIPTION:
This website was built so that people can contact me and learn a little about me. It contains the links to all my socials including my github, and you're here already so... Anyways, it was built with just HTML, CSS Bootstrap, and a little JS. It is responsive in all gadgets.
